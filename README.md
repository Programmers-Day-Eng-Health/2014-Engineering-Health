## Busy Engineer
	Engineering is a busy job. Every day you rush to the cube for scrum, then you design, code, test and bla bla bla.
	If thats not enough, you have code cutoff and other deadlines.  But then there come these events like geek-trivias, 		hack-nights, 	conferences, tech-talks, coding competitions, developers coferences. Without these events life would 		be real boring. Its thsese events that make the life exciting for an engineer.
	In this game, you use left and right arrow to move the engineer to catch up with these events. The more you are able to 	participate in these events, higher you score.
	
	Prerequisite: python 2.7.8
	To run: just click on the BusyEngineer.py and enjoy the game.
