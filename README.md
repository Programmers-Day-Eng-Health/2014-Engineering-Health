## Ping Me
	So i was having this problem where the cerner release repo would be down and
	i had to constantly check if it was up, therefore i just wrote a simple java 	
	program to ping the server until it was finally up. 
	Compile: javac PingMe.java
	Run: java PingMe <url_to_ping>
		 Example: java PingMe http://www.google.com
